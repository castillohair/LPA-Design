        Save additional files required for the Replicate Setup stage.

        The name of the LPA, used to load calibration info, should be

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str
            Folder in which to save files.

        Notes
        -----
        This function uses the LPA object in the ``lpa`` attribute to save
        the LPA files. To do so, the following is performed on ``lpa``:

        1. LPA name is obtained from the ``resources`` attribute, and LED
          layout names from LPA inducers. Calibration info is loaded.
        2. Time step and number of steps are obtained from the LPA
          inducers.
        3. The ``lpa.intensity`` array is filled from the inducers. If all
          intensities at all times are identical, the array is condensed
          into a single-frame program.
        4. An additional dark frame is added if ``lpa_end_with_leds_off``
          is True.
        5. Dot correction values for channel ``i`` are optimized if
          ``lpa_optimize_dc[i]`` is True, with the ``uniform`` option
          as given by ``lpa_optimize_dc_uniform[i]``.
        6. Intensities are discretized with ``lpa.discretize_intensity()``,
          and the LPA files are saved.

        Any modifications to ``lpa`` that interfere with this process are
        discouraged.

        Save additional files required for the Replicate Setup stage.

        This function saves LPA files inside subfolder `lpa_files_path`,
        which is in turn created inside `path`.

        The name of the LPAs, used to load calibration info, should be
        specified as a plate resource.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str
            Folder in which to save files.

        Notes
        -----
        This function uses the LPA objects in the ``lpas`` attribute to
        save the LPA files. To do so, the following is performed:

        1. LPA name is obtained from the ``resources`` attribute, and LED
          layout names from LPA inducers. Calibration info is loaded.
        2. Time step and number of steps are obtained from the LPA
          inducers.
        3. The ``lpa.intensity`` array is filled from the inducers. If all
          intensities at all times are identical, the array is condensed
          into a single-frame program.
        4. An additional dark frame is added if ``lpa_end_with_leds_off``
          is True.
        5. Dot correction values for channel ``i`` are optimized if
          ``lpa_optimize_dc[i]`` is True, with the ``uniform`` option
          as given by ``lpa_optimize_dc_uniform[i]``.
        6. Intensities are discretized with ``lpa.discretize_intensity()``,
          and the LPA files are saved.

        Any modifications to ``lpas`` that interfere with this process are
        discouraged.
